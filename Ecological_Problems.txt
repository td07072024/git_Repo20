Gir National Park and Sanctuary faces a number of threats to its ecosystem. Natural threats include recurrent drought, cyclones, and forest fires.[16] Anthropogenic threats include over-grazing,[17] encroachment, excessive traffic and resultant weed infestation.[16][18] Tourism contributes to this environmental degradation, as does the mining carried out in the periphery. Pollution results from the railway lines that run through the peripheral zone.[16] The narrow genetic base in the large mammals is also an issue of growing concern.[16][19]
